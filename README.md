# Cayo-Perico-Gas-pumps
This is my first YMap im uploading, just simply adds fuel pumps that work with most fuel scripts ( Made specifically for NoPixel's) to the new Cayo Perico island for FiveM

This simply adds a gas pump to the already created Y-Map by 
Unbrela#0001 (Made RequestIPL / Converted Insland and Fixed Texture Size)
KrizFrost#9521 (Made Script to drain the water)
find their scripts here: https://forum.cfx.re/t/the-cayo-perico-island-available-for-fivem/1897446

I DID NOT MAKE THIS YMAP I SIMPLY ADDED A GAS PUMP AND WILL BE ADDING MORE TO THE ISLAND! 

To install simply drag the file from the folder and replace the already exsisting file located in your Cayo_Perico_UpdatedV#/stream folder
